# ECMA-xxx-VERS (VERS Specification)

This repository hosts the work-in-progress technical specification for **VERS**, which is being developed under Ecma International's **Technical Committee 54 (TC54)**.

## Purpose of the Repository

The repository serves as the collaborative workspace for drafting, reviewing, and refining the VERS specification. Contributions from TC54 and its task groups (e.g., TG2) ensure that the specification aligns with international standardization goals and reflects the needs of global stakeholders.

### Key Objectives
- To develop the normative specification for the VERS syntax, its required components, and conformance requirements.
- To provide a clear, authoritative reference for implementers, developers, and organisations adopting VERS.
- To maintain transparency and encourage participation from all stakeholders.

### Important Note on Repository Name

This repository is currently named `ECMA-xxx-VERS` as a placeholder. Upon ratification of the VERS specification as an Ecma International standard, the repository will be renamed to **`ECMA-xxx`**, where `xxx` represents the number assigned by Ecma to the standard.

## Contributing

Contributions to this specification are managed by TC54. If you are part of the TC54 community or have been invited to collaborate, please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in this repository.
